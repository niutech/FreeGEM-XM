This directory (GDOS\OBJWOSRC) contains two object files for the GEM/XM
GDOS/GEMVDI, for which the source code has been non forthcoming.  This
is presumably due to corruption or loss before they were released under
the GPL.  Because of this, I've copied them out of the main build
directory in case they get deleted during a cleanup or somesuch.

These two components are critical to the operation of the GDOS - one is
likely to be the VDI itself, and the other is the code responsible for
loading and executing the VDI (and possibly other applications).  The
two equivalent files from the GEM/3, ViewMAX and FreeGEM VDIs do not
appear to be simply interchangable.

Also included in this directory are two files containing LINK86 output
when the objects are linked without the rest of the FreeGEM/XM GDOS
(showing the symbols these OBJs import from the other code), and when
the remaining code is linked without these two files (showing which
symbols these OBJs export to the rest of the GDOS).  More detailed
information is contained within the object files themselves.
